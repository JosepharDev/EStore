        <h2 style="color: #333;">1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>At <strong>EStore</strong>, we want to ensure that you are completely satisfied with your purchase. This Return Policy explains how you can return or exchange items purchased on our website. Please read the policy carefully to understand your rights and responsibilities.</p>

        <h2 style="color: #333;">2. Digital Products</h2>
        <p>Due to the nature of digital products (e.g., images, digital downloads), all sales are final. We do not offer returns, exchanges, or refunds on digital items once the purchase is completed and the download link has been provided or accessed. However, if you encounter an issue with the product (e.g., file corruption or errors), please contact our customer support team, and we will resolve the issue.</p>

        <h2 style="color: #333;">3. Physical Products (if applicable)</h2>
        <p>If you have purchased physical products (e.g., prints, posters), the following return and exchange policies apply:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Return Period:</strong> You have 30 days from the date of delivery to initiate a return for physical products.</li>
            <li><strong>Eligibility for Return:</strong> To be eligible for a return, the item must be unused, in its original condition, and in the original packaging. It must also include any accessories or documentation that came with it.</li>
            <li><strong>Return Process:</strong> To begin a return, please contact our customer support team at <a href="mailto:support@estore.com" style="color: #333;">support@estore.com</a>. Include your order number, the item(s) you wish to return, and the reason for the return.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 style="color: #333;">4. Refunds</h2>
        <p>If your return is approved, we will process a refund to your original payment method. Refunds will be issued for the cost of the item(s) only, excluding any shipping fees. Please allow 7-10 business days for the refund to appear on your account.</p>

        <h2 style="color: #333;">5. Exchanges</h2>
        <p>If you wish to exchange a physical product for a different item, please follow the return process outlined above and then place a new order for the desired item. Unfortunately, we do not offer direct exchanges; returns must be processed first, and a new purchase is required.</p>

        <h2 style="color: #333;">6. Non-returnable Items</h2>
        <p>Some items are non-returnable and non-refundable, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Gift cards</li>
            <li>Downloadable digital products (such as images, templates, etc.)</li>
            <li>Items that have been opened or used</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 style="color: #333;">7. Damaged or Defective Items</h2>
        <p>If you receive a damaged or defective product, please contact us immediately at <a href="mailto:support@estore.com" style="color: #333;">support@estore.com</a> with your order number, a description of the issue, and photos of the damage or defect. We will offer you a replacement or a full refund for the item in question.</p>

        <h2 style="color: #333;">8. Shipping Costs for Returns</h2>
        <p>For returns of physical products, you are responsible for the shipping costs associated with returning the item. We recommend using a trackable shipping service or purchasing shipping insurance, as we cannot guarantee that we will receive your returned item. Shipping costs are non-refundable.</p>

        <h2 style="color: #333;">9. Address for Returns</h2>
        <p>To return a physical product, please ship it to the following address:</p>
